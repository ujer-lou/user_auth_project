### Review:
1. **`Dockerfile`:**
   - You’ve added `RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y postgresql-client && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*`, which correctly installs `psql`. Great!

2. **`docker-compose up --build` Output:**
   - The build completed successfully, and all containers (`app`, `db`, `redis`, `rabbitmq`) are running. No errors in the output—perfect!

3. **`docker-compose exec app python manage.py dbshell`:**
   - The command opened a PostgreSQL shell (`psql`) successfully, confirming the database connection is working with `DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:postgres@db:5432/user_auth_db`. Excellent!

4. **API Files:**
   - `accounts/serializers.py`, `accounts/views.py`, `accounts/urls.py`, and `user_auth_project/urls.py` match the code I provided. They’re correctly set up for the login/register system, email verification, and password reset.

5. **`.env` File:**
   - You didn’t share the updated `.env` with the corrected password, but based on the successful `dbshell` connection, I assume you fixed it to `DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:postgres@db:5432/user_auth_db`. Please confirm this in your next response.

### What’s Next:
Since everything is set up correctly, we can proceed to test the API endpoints and ensure Celery with RabbitMQ works for email verification. We’ll also address any minor tweaks (like the `.env` confirmation) and prepare for testing.

### Step 5: Test the API and Configure Celery
Let’s test the API endpoints and ensure Celery/RabbitMQ handles email verification asynchronously.

#### What to Do:
1. **Test API Endpoints:**
   - Use a tool like `curl`, Postman, or `httpie` to test the endpoints. Make sure `docker-compose up` is running in one terminal. Open another terminal for testing:
     - **Register a User:**
       ```bash
       curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/register/ -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"email": "user@example.com", "username": "user", "password": "securepassword123"}'
       ```
       - Expected response: `{"message": "User registered. Check your email for verification code.", "user_id": 1}` (Note: Email won’t actually send yet because we need to configure Celery properly).

     - **Verify Email:**
       ```bash
       curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/verify-email/ -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"user_id": 1, "code": "123456"}'
       ```
       - Expected response: `{"message": "Email verified successfully."}` (if the code matches and hasn’t expired).

     - **Login:**
       ```bash
       curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/login/ -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"email": "user@example.com", "password": "securepassword123"}'
       ```
       - Expected response: `{"message": "Login successful."}` (after email verification).

     - **Request Password Reset:**
       ```bash
       curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/password-reset/ -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"email": "user@example.com"}'
       ```
       - Expected response: `{"message": "Password reset link sent to your email."}` (email won’t send yet).

     - **Confirm Password Reset:**
       ```bash
       curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/password-reset/confirm/ -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"token": "token-uuid-from-email", "new_password": "newsecurepassword123"}'
       ```
       - Expected response: `{"message": "Password reset successful."}` (if the token is valid and hasn’t expired).

   - Note: For now, email sending will fail silently (`fail_silently=True`) because we need to configure Celery/RabbitMQ properly. We’ll address that next.

2. **Configure Celery for Email Verification:**
   - Ensure Celery is running to handle background tasks (like `send_verification_email`). We already set up Celery in `settings.py` and `views.py`, but we need to start a Celery worker.
   - In a new terminal, run:
     ```bash
     docker-compose exec app celery -A user_auth_project worker --loglevel=info
     ```
   - This starts a Celery worker in the `app` container, listening to RabbitMQ for tasks. Keep this terminal running.

3. **Test Email Verification Again:**
   - Repeat the registration test (`curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/register/ ...`) to trigger the `send_verification_email` task. Check the Celery worker logs to ensure the task is processed.
   - Note: Emails won’t send unless your Gmail SMTP settings (`EMAIL_HOST_USER` and `EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD` in `.env`) are correctly configured and Gmail allows less secure apps or you’ve set up an app-specific password.

4. **Verify RabbitMQ and Celery Integration:**
   - Open the RabbitMQ management UI at `http://localhost:15672` (username: `guest`, password: `guest`) to check if tasks are queued.
   - Ensure the Celery worker logs show tasks being received and processed.

#### What to Send Me:
- Confirmation that you updated `.env` to `DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:postgres@db:5432/user_auth_db` (just the line if updated).
- Terminal output from testing at least one API endpoint (e.g., registration) using `curl` or another tool.
- Terminal output from `docker-compose exec app celery -A user_auth_project worker --loglevel=info` (first 20-30 lines or until a task is processed).
- Any errors or issues you encounter during testing.

---

### Next Step Decision:
- **If API endpoints work and Celery/RabbitMQ handle tasks successfully:** We’ll finalize the project, test scalability, and ensure it can handle 10k+ users.
- **If there are errors:** We’ll troubleshoot (e.g., email configuration, Celery setup, or API issues).

You’re doing incredibly well—let’s test the API and get email verification working!
